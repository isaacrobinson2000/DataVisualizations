1.) Avoid too little contrast to the background.

 - Can be hard to read and distingush.
 - Can happen if your colors are too desaturated/light.

 - How to fix:
   - Increase the saturation, or make the colors darker.

2.) Avoid too much contrast with the backround.

 - Decrease saturation/darkness to fix.

3.) Choose a background that’s desaturated enough.

 - Colorful backgrounds can distract from the figure and data.
 - Should go with desaturated backgrounds.

 - If you want a light background, stay away from colors 
   below 95% lightness and above 7% saturation.

 - If you want a dark background, stay below 20% saturation. 
   Also, don’t go full black – keep your lightness between 10% 
   and 25%.

4.) Copy colors, or understand them.

 - I do this quite a bit myself.
 - Its ok to be bad with colors, just copy colors schemes from things you like.
    - Whether that's good:
       - Data Visualizations
       - Movies, Artists, other color palletes or colormaps.

    - Many of these people have spent of time studying and selecting colors.

 - Use tools to help you pick color schemes.
 - Many plotting tools come with very carefully selected colormaps.


QUESTIONS:

1.) It can be seen that some colors evoke certain emotions or
   have certain connontations tied to them. Do you
   think that this can be taken advantage of in data 
   visualizations, and how so?

2.) Where else do you think one can find good colormaps, or find
   insparation for good colormaps, other then the resources 
   listed in the last section? Have you found any tools 
   you like to use for generating colormaps?
