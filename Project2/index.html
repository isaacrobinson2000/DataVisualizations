        <p>
            The goal of this experiment was to determine if Rats have a preferential attention for objects which
            appear to look like them. Each rat was placed in a box with 4 objects, two which look like rats (one
            was slightly deformed), and two other objects with arbitrary appearance (lions, deformed and not deformed).
            The rats were left in the cage for 3 minutes and filmed. The process was repeated with a box with nothing
            in it as a control. The nose of each rat was tracked using a webcam placed above the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following plots are heatmaps which display the amount of time the rat's nose spent in each section
            within the video. The heatmap is placed over a still image from the video to indicate the location of
            each social object, as the social object were moved between experiments. Use the selection dropdown at
            the bottom to change the rat being looked at and also the bin size.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results overall are mixed, and indicate the hypothesis is not true. With the exception of
            rat 2, all of the rats spent more time around the locations of the social objects as compared to the
            control run. Rat 1 spends more time around one of the lions, and rats 2 and 3 spend an evenly distributed
            amount of time around all of the social objects. Only rats 5 and 6 conform to the hypothesis and spend more
            time around the objects which look like rats.
