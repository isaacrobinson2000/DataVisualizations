            <p>
                The goal of this visual was to determine if stasis occurred more frequently
                in Poleis that were smaller in area. Interpreting the visuals, we see that
                stasis events seem to act mostly independently of polis size, and the scatter plot
                confirms this, only hinting at a small negative correlation, which could simply
                be attributed to noise. The histogram shows much stronger correlation between
                the total area controlled by a polis and the number of stasis, showing a positive
                correlation. The results indicate hypothesis is most likely false, but it seems
                more data is needed before this can be confirmed.
