                COVID-19 initially had a significant impact on store supply chains, at a time making it difficult to buy
                food from stores. This raises the question, did households buy surplus food in correlation with the
                rise of COVID in the U.S.? The following graphs display consumer expenditures for different
                categories of products as a percentage of total consumer expenditures.

                <i>Consumer Expendures</i>, as
                defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the average amount of money spent on items by U.S.
                consumers. Expenditures are broken down into both general(Ex. Food) and specific(Ex. Dairy) spending
                categories.

            <p>
                The following plots indicate a decrease in food spending mostly due to less money being spent on food
                away from home (such as at a restaurant). The increase in food spending at home is rather small,
                indicating that households likely did not stockpile large amounts food in response to COVID.

                Other interesting trends include decreases in spending on apparel (clothes), and
                personal care products while increased spending can be seen for housing/home goods, healthcare,
                and donations. All these changes correspond to the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic.
